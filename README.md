`revision 1.1`

Welcome to the August Ash Frontend Developer Challenge. This is a chance for you to show us your skills and provide us some insight on how you approach problem-solving.

It's important to note that this is by no means a test. Our team just wants to get a sense of how you write code and solve frontend problems.

## Details for Submission

As developers we rely heavily on tools like Github. Please fork this repository and use your clone for developing the challenge. When complete, submit a pull request with your changes for our team to review.

## What You'll Need to Build

Using the design assets provided, translate the flat design (located in `assets/design/` directory) into a static HTML page.

### Guidelines

*You are encouraged to be creative and use any coding techniques you have in your arsenal*. We want to emphasize that the translation of this design into code is open to your interpretation. That said, here are a few guidelines that must be followed:

- It is only necessary to develop the provided design. No interior pages, PHP functionality, or database integration is necessary.
- Although a mobile design mockup is not provided, this design needs to be responsive. Use your own creativity and best judgment to adjust the layout for any device size.
- The large image area in the design concept implies that there is a rotating slideshow.
- The font used in the design is a free font named `Lato`.
- Do not use a Content Management System or other template-based platforms.
- Include all your development or source files.
- The provided images are high-res originals. Feel free to edit them as needed.

## What We Are Looking For

- We expect clean, valid, and semantic HTML markup.
- Is your code commented? What is your code doing and, more importantly, why?
- Does your Sass structure and technique make sense?
- Did you use JavaScript properly? Did you author it or leverage frameworks?
- We expect helpful Git commit messages, a clean history, and use of branching.

## Bonus

- We gave you a flat, static, design mockup. Bring the design to life and impress us with appropriately-used hover effects, animations, or transitions.
- Use the provided JSON file to build the grid portion of the challenge. It would be super neat to see some AJAX (the `data.json` file can be edited as needed).
